    "## Recap\n",
    "We decided to research traffic in Slovenia. <br/>\n",
    "The most of our focus went to car accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "- Number of car accidents changing over the years\n",
    "- What part of the year has on average the most accidents \n",
    "- Number or fatal car accidents per year\n",
    "- Number of people killed in car accidents per year\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "We gathered data from the next sources:<br/>\n",
    "- [OPSI](https://podatki.gov.si/data/search?open_data=True&all_podrocje=Promet%20in%20infrastruktura)(Odprti Podatki Slovenije)\n",
    "- [SiStat](https://pxweb.stat.si/SiStat/)(Slovenski Statistični Urad)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Percentage of accidents from\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see on average the most accidents happens in October.  Surprisingly the least accidents happens in winter.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is probably because of weather. It is snowing the roads are in condition where you cannot develop high-speed, and you probably pay extra attention when you drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number of accidents for each year from 2003 to 2014\n",
    "![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipLukic415/PR19FMMI/master/SteviloNesrecPolLetih.PNG)\n",
    "As we can see, the number of fatal accidents between years 2003 and 2014 has declined by quite a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could assume that this is because of bigger fines, stricter traffic regulations and safety technology in cars improved over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we look at the next graph where we can see these numbers divided by type of road.\n",
    "\n",
    "** INSERT BAŠA+FILIP GRAPH **\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number of fatal accidents from 2007 to 2014\n",
    "![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipLukic415/PR19FMMI/master/chart.png)\n",
    "Fortunately also the number of fatal accidents significantly decreased for the same reasons explained before, thanks to technological improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number of people killed in accidents from 2007 to 2014\n",
    "![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipLukic415/PR19FMMI/master/npersonkilled.png)\n",
    "Here we can see more in detail the number of people killed in these accidents. \n",
    "In the last few years the amount settled around 130 person per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number of people injured in traffic accidents from 2007 to 2014\n",
    "\n",
    "![woundedrepaired.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipLukic415/PR19FMMI/master/woundedrepaired.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the number decreased by 40k in 9 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we try to plot the same graph but by ratio of men/women injured in traffic accidents, we can see that women were always safer drivers? less prone to injury.\n",

    "![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipLukic415/PR19FMMI/master/involvedInAccidentsColorFix.PNG)\n",
    "If we compare the number of people involved in accidents in each year from 2007 to 2014 we can see that it deacres by 3k people in 7 years.\n",
    "Even if it's not possible to decrease the number of dead people to zero, if we split the people involved in: killed, seriously injured, slighty injured and not injured at all we can see that the number of people not withiout injures it's really high adn the number of people killed it's really low.\n",
