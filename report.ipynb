    "## Recap\n",
    "We decided to research traffic in Slovenia. <br/>\n",
    "The most of our focus went to car accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "- Number of car accidents changing over the years\n",
    "- What part of the year has on average the most accidents \n",
    "- Number or fatal car accidents per year\n",
    "- Number of people killed in car accidents per year\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "We gathered data from the next sources:<br/>\n",
    "- [OPSI](https://podatki.gov.si/data/search?open_data=True&all_podrocje=Promet%20in%20infrastruktura)(Odprti Podatki Slovenije)\n",
    "- [SiStat](https://pxweb.stat.si/SiStat/)(Slovenski Statistični Urad)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see on average the most accidents happens in October.  Surprisingly the least accidents happens in winter.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is probably because of weather. It is snowing the roads are in condition where you cannot develop high-speed, and you probably pay extra attention when you drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number of accidents for each year from 2003 to 2014\n",
    "![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipLukic415/PR19FMMI/master/SteviloNesrecPolLetih.PNG)\n",
    "As we can see, the number of fatal accidents between years 2003 and 2014 has declined by quite a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could assume that this is because of bigger fines, stricter traffic regulations and safety technology in cars improved over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we look at the next graph where we can see these numbers divided by type of road.\n",

    "![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipLukic415/PR19FMMI/master/chart.png)\n",
    "Fortunately also the number of fatal accidents significantly decreased for the same reasons explained before, thanks to technological improvements.\n",

    "### Number of people killed in accidents from 2007 to 2014\n",
    "![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipLukic415/PR19FMMI/master/npersonkilled.png)\n",
    "Here we can see more in detail the number of people killed in these accidents. \n",
    "In the last few years the amount settled around 130 person per year.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can see that the number decreased by 40k in 9 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we try to plot the same graph but by ratio of men/women injured in traffic accidents, we can see that women were always safer drivers? less prone to injury.\n",

    "If we compare the number of people involved in accidents in each year from 2007 to 2014 we can see that it deacres by 3k people in 7 years.\n",
    "Even if it's not possible to decrease the number of dead people to zero, if we split the people involved in: killed, seriously injured, slighty injured and not injured at all we can see that the number of people not withiout injures it's really high adn the number of people killed it's really low.\n",

    "### Summary -  traffic accidents \n",
    "\n",
    "In our research of the traffic accidents in republic of Slovenia we have used data from this officcial bureau site (link) and european annual accident report for 2018. Our research has revealed a few interesting points.\n",
    "Firstly the number of accidents is dropping dramatically in the past two decades. The year 2004 was critical as then, the most accidents occurred. Since then the number of accidents is falling ( from some 12.963 accidents with fatal outcome or injury as result to about 6253 in 2014).\n",
    "We presumed that the most accidents would occur on the highways or motorways (110- 130  km / h), instead the biggest number was in the urban area where the top speed is up to 50 km /h.\n",
    "To this we can probably acredit the fact that urban districts are areas where the paths of motortransport and pedestrian/cyclist traffic intersect, also narrower roads might contribute to this.\n",
    "Again we should consider that a lot of accidents occur when the speed limits are not taken into account, then again most speeding tickets in urban areas are given for 10-20 km / h speed violation ( a pearson cannot physically increase speed in given areas, say with broken asphalt, narrow bridge crossing).\n",
    "Another interesting fact is that number of fatally injured is also dropping. The peak was in 2007 with around 250 deaths and eventually falling to about a hundred in 2014. We believe that national assembly act such as the mandatory use of safety belts, adequate signalisation and rigourous chastitment  are reasons for this decline.\n",
    "The ratio between male and female mortalities was a bit different than we thought at first. If we say that on average there are a same number of male and female drivers we could reasonably expect that the number of injuries and fatalities are equally distributed. This statement was utterly wrong.\n",
    "The data provided reveals a huge gap between male and female death in road accidents with around 75% dead are male and 25 % female.\n",
    "Interesting conclusion is also that with the number of newly registered vehicles, which is quickly rising eventhough the population is shrinking, the number of accidents is dropping with it again the number of mortalities.\n",
    "To summarise we can agree that the today traffic on Slovenian soil is quite safer as it was previously in the past two decades. The infrastructure is well mantained, penal-law  system is well synhronised with european standards and with a great deal on goverment projects a certain culture of normal driver morals is being formed.  \n",
